It's minesweeper!

Built in a weekend to exercise my JavaScript skills and to simply see if I could do it in a short time-frame.

The fun stuff happens in minefield.js' RevealSquare function!

Coming up with the algorithms to handle exposing blank squares and populate mine-adjacent squares with numbers
were fun challenges and I learned a few techniques to avoid creating recursive functions, as well as techniques
related to optimizing 2 dimensional grid traversal and removing arbitrary checks to already revealed squares.
